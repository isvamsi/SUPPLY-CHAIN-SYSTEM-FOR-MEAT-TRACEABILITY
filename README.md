# SUPPLY-CHAIN-SYSTEM-FOR-MEAT-TRACEABILITY-
Project focuses on creating a system that ensures the transparency, safety, and traceability of meat products from farm to table. The primary goal is to track the journey of meat, ensuring quality, safety, and compliance with regulations, while also providing information to consumers about the source and handling of the products.


# Supply Chain System for Meat Traceability

## Overview
The **Supply Chain System for Meat Traceability** is a solution designed to ensure transparency, safety, and traceability of meat products from farm to table. This system enables tracking of meat products at every stage of the supply chain, providing valuable information to consumers, regulators, and producers. It uses technologies such as RFID, blockchain, and real-time monitoring to ensure food safety, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust.

## Features
- **End-to-End Traceability**: Tracks meat products from farm to slaughterhouse, processing, and retail.
- **Data Collection & Storage**: Captures relevant data at every stage of the supply chain and stores it securely.
- **Barcode/RFID Technology**: Uses RFID tags and barcodes for real-time scanning and tracking.
- **Blockchain for Transparency**: Ensures tamper-proof records of the supply chain.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Monitors and ensures compliance with food safety regulations.
- **Consumer Access**: Allows consumers to scan QR codes and view the meat product's history.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks and sends alerts for issues like temperature control, contamination, or expired products.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Provides detailed reports and analytics on supply chain performance, product safety, and compliance.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: To create a transparent, immutable record of the supply chain.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface for consumers and suppliers to access traceability information.
- **Database Management System**: To store and manage supply chain data securely.
